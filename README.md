Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for Handwritten Numeric Grids

# Project Description
* The project involved the creation of an advanced OCR system tailored specifically for recognizing and converting handwritten numeric characters into their digital counterparts

# Input Data
* Comprised images of grids filled with human-written numbers

# Models used
* Paddle OCR
* Easy OCR
* Tesseract

# Technical Approach
* Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathered a diverse dataset with handwritten numbers including various handwriting styles, and grid sizes. Preprocessing techniques such as binarization, and padding were applied to standardize the input images
* Model Development: Leveraged multiple OCR models such as Paddle, Easy and Tesseract to solve the problem and used results of all 3 models to optimize the error. Trained the model on MNIST dataset

# Future Scope
* Incorporating the trained OCR model into a user-friendly interface that allows for easy uploading and processing of grid images
* Improve model development process to increase the Recoginition accuracy
